Game is called Cave Escape

It's a simple play through at the moment but after its updated at the end it wil have more in it and will take more time tp complete.

The story itself can be seen through the demo of the game site. In addition to this there is also a twine document linked to it which acts as a top down map. The story is likely to expand at somepoint this is just a working model
of what it will develop into.In the Atom file there are basic images for the implementation of changing the weapon the guard will use which gets taken by 
the player. This will be added later on as well as developed, this is the same as with background colours as photos will be inserted in at a later date. 
There would be the story diagram as well but did not upload correctly. Player colour will also be a useful property later on. Review on tab.

Please click the game tab next to home after you have finished :)
